//
// DailySnapshot: the deep read module for "a user's day". One interface —
// forDay(userId, date) — over a single backend call, with per-section error
// isolation and a cache-first read for today. Absorbs the old MetricsService.
// See docs/adr/0002-daily-snapshot-module.md and docs/adr/0004.
//
// It used to fan out across seven endpoints in parallel (one of which read the
// user's entire weight history and scanned it client-side). The backend now
// serves the whole owner day in one request, so forDay swaps its internals
// behind the same interface — which is what that interface was for.
